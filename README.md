#CS210 - Project One
The project was to create two clocks, one 12hr and the other 24hour and allow the user to select from 4 options in a menu. The first option is to add an hour, the seconds is to add a minute and the third, to add a second to the time of both clocks. I think I formatted the program to look like it should in the project discription very well and gave good feedback to the users. To enhance my code, I could have used a switch statement as opposed to if else statements for user selection validation which would have made the code more readable. At some point when testing, I realized I was getting an infinite loop, and fixing that turned out to be a little challenging. I used stackoverflow and documentations to help with solving the issue. Something I learned that can be passed on to other projects is to use good comments when writing code to help not only myself but others who may review my code understand why I made certain decision. I made the program maintainable, readable and adaptable by using good in-line comments, and having adequate space between functions and lines.
